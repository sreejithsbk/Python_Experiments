-- The below code just means every letter in the string "Giraffe Academy"

for letter in "Giraffe Academy"

     or
     
for letter in "Sreejith Balakrishnan":
     print(letter)
     
-- Another example 

friends = ["Kevin", "Martin", "John"]
for friend in friends:
    print(friend)
    
    or

for i in friends:

-- Below prints out a range of index numbers , in the below case it prints from 0-29 excluding 30

for index in range(30):
    print(index)
    
-- Below will print out a range of index values starting from 10-29 and not including 30

for index in range( 10, 30):
    print(index)

-- you can use range function to list the number of elements in an array

friends = ["Kevin", "Tony", "Boomb"]
#len(friends)
for index in range(len(friends)):
    print(index)
    
0 , 1, 2  -- resut
-- The len function tells you how many elements are there in array, it retuns 3

friends = ["Kevin", "Tony", "Boomb"]
print(len(friends))
