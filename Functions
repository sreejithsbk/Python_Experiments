-- Function are a set of code that perform an activity which you can call inside of your code at anytime

def say_hi():
    print("Hello guys !!!")

say_hi()

-- Giving Parameter inside of the function in order to receive some paramter to perform the function.

def say_hi(name):
    print("Hello Mr. " + name)

say_hi("harish")
say_hi("Girish")
say_hi("Manish")

-- We pass on two parameter , however when we are displaying the age the age needs to be converted to string using "str" as we are passing 
-- the values as integers

def say_hi(name, age):
    print("Hello Mr. " + name + "and your age is " + str(age))

say_hi("harish", 23)
say_hi("Girish", 55)
say_hi("Manish", 40)

-- we are passing the age as strings in the below case therefore you don't have to convert it to string in the second example below.

def say_hi(name, age):
    print("Hello Mr. " + name + "and your age is " + age)

say_hi("harish", "23")
say_hi("harish", "55")
